**Instructor:** Monika Stepanyan

## Overview

This project implements a Jigsaw Sudoku game with a user interface and a solver utilizing artificial intelligence techniques. Jigsaw Sudoku is a variation of classic Sudoku that adds irregularly shaped regions, making the puzzle more challenging.

## Project Structure

* **core:** Contains the core classes and logic for representing the Jigsaw Sudoku grid and rules.
* **generator:** Includes classes responsible for generating new Jigsaw Sudoku problems with varying difficulty levels.
* **solver:** Houses the solver classes that implement various AI algorithms (e.g., backtracking, constraint propagation) to solve the generated puzzles.
* **ui:** Provides the graphical user interface (GUI) components for user interaction, puzzle display, and solution visualization.
